# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Labs â€“ Apprentice Level

This folder contains my reports and evidence for the **9 Apprentice-level XSS labs** from PortSwigger Web Security Academy.  
All work documented here is performed **only in legal lab environments** (PortSwigger Academy, OWASP Juice Shop, TryHackMe).

## ðŸ”Ž Methodology
Each lab write-up includes:
1. Context (where the vulnerability occurs)  
2. Payloads used (lab-only, safe)  
3. Evidence (screenshots)  
4. Impact (real-world risk)  
5. Remediation steps
